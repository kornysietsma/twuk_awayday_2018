# Visualising Toxic Code
Docs and links for my talk at the Thoughtworks UK 2018 away day

This repo is mostly so I can provide a single landing page for
people who want to view my source code, or demos.  It's pretty thin
right now, I'll hopefully be adding bits at the last minute!

## Toxic Code Explorer

Source code for the demo is at https://github.com/kornysietsma/toxic-code-explorer-demo-twuk2018

This is a temporary repo with last-minute tweaks for my talk - there's a master version at https://github.com/kornysietsma/toxic-code-explorer-demo which should be around for longer.
